\section{Introduction}
In the more than 60 years of its existence the Fortran programming
language has undergone many changes, both in accordance with general insights
in programming paradigms and in reaction to developments in computer hardware.
This document discusses some of the idioms one finds in old FORTRAN packages
and their modern alternatives.

Please be aware that the use of lowercase and uppercase forms of the name is
not a whimsicality but rather marks a revolution within the language that was
started with the publication of the Fortran 90 standard in 1990(?). Throughout
this document we will use this distinction which is much more than merely
typographic.

The set-up is simple and ad hoc: we discuss various idioms that have been
used in the past decades and present contemporary equivalents or alternatives.
Attempts are made to present them in a systematic way, but that mostly means grouping
related topics.

\section{Subjects}
\begin{verbatim}
- array(*) versus array(:)
- array(10) as the starting point
- history of computers:
   - hardware
   - memory management
   - tools like source code control systems
   - connections between computers, Internet
- equivalence
- constants as actual arguments
- intent
- temporary arrays - non-contiguous arrays
- implicit types
- double precision versus kind
- checking interfaces
- separate compilations, the misunderstanding of one routine per file
- fixed form and spaces
- standard input and output
- LU-numbers 5 and 6 (and 7)
- command-line arguments for file names
- real do-variables
- entry
- statement functions
- six characters
- numerical binary representations versus IEEE (IBM, Cray, Convex)
- big-endian and little-endian
- double complex
- unformatted versus binary files
- list-directed input and output - also: /
- narrow formats (?)
- use of d00 in input
- Cray pointers
- uppercase/lowercase letters
- D as comment character
- external, also notation "*tan"
- FORTRAN 66 semantics: OPEN - STATUS = 'NEW' as default.
- Effect of BLANK = 'ZERO' versus BLANK = 'NULL'
- Specific names for functions like max() and sin()
- Alternate return
- Equating logicals: logical x, y; if ( x .eq. y ) then
- r1mach and friends
- Hollerith
- DECODE/ENCODE:

From discourse: (19 june 2023)
   CHARACTER S*6 / '987654' /, T*6
   INTEGER V(3)*4
   DECODE( 6, '(3I2)', S ) V
   WRITE( *, '(3I3)') V
   ENCODE( 6, '(3I2)', T ) V(3), V(2), V(1)
   PRINT *, T
   END

The above program has this output:

98 76 54
547698

The DECODE reads the characters of S as 3 integers, and stores them into V(1), V(2), and V(3).
The ENCODE statement writes the values V(3), V(2), and V(1) into T as characters; T then contains '547698'.
