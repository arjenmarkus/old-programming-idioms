\section{Introduction}
In the more than 60 years of its existence the Fortran programming
language has undergone many changes, both in accordance with general insights
in programming paradigms and in reaction to developments in computer hardware.
This document discusses some of the idioms one finds in old FORTRAN packages
and their modern alternatives.

Please be aware that the use of lowercase and uppercase forms of the name is
not a whimsicality but rather marks a revolution within the language that was
started with the publication of the Fortran 90 standard \cite{Fortran90Standard}. Throughout
this document we will use this distinction which is much more than merely
typographic.

The set-up is simple and ad hoc: we discuss various idioms that have been
used in the past decades and present contemporary equivalents or alternatives.
Attempts are made to present them in a systematic way, but that mostly means grouping
related topics.

Of course, a document like this can hardly be complete\, but hopefully it is
useful enough. Another source of information you may want to read is the page on the Fortran Wiki
dedicated to old-style Fortran \cite{ModernizeOldFortran}.

\section{Subjects still to cover}
\begin{verbatim}
- array(*) versus array(:)
- history of computers:
   - hardware
   - memory management
   - tools like source code control systems
   - connections between computers, Internet
- numerical binary representations versus IEEE (IBM, Cray, Convex)
- list-directed input and output - also: /
- narrow formats (?)
- use of d00 in input
- external, also notation "*tan"
- EXTERNAL for an intrinsic procedure
- FORTRAN 66 semantics: OPEN - STATUS = 'NEW' as default.
- Effect of BLANK = 'ZERO' versus BLANK = 'NULL'
- character*1 a*2
\end{verbatim}

%- command-line arguments for file names
%- Cray pointers
%- Equating logicals: logical x, y; if ( x .eq. y ) then
%- Declaring an argument to be a scalar but using it as an array
%- r1mach and friends
%- intent
%- checking interfaces
%- equivalence
%- big-endian and little-endian
%- double complex
%- double precision versus kind
%- temporary arrays - non-contiguous arrays
%- six characters
%- constants as actual arguments
%- fixed form and spaces
%- array(10) as the starting point
%- implicit types
%- separate compilations, the misunderstanding of one routine per file
%- LU-numbers 5 and 6 (and 7)
%- standard input and output
%- real do-variables
%- entry
%- statement functions
%- unformatted versus binary files
%- uppercase/lowercase letters
%- D as comment character
%- Specific names for functions like max() and sin()
%- Alternate return

%- DECODE/ENCODE:
%
%From discourse: (19 june 2023)
%   CHARACTER S*6 / '987654' /, T*6
%   INTEGER V(3)*4
%   DECODE( 6, '(3I2)', S ) V
%   WRITE( *, '(3I3)') V
%   ENCODE( 6, '(3I2)', T ) V(3), V(2), V(1)
%   PRINT *, T
%   END
%
%The above program has this output:
%
%98 76 54
%547698
%
%The DECODE reads the characters of S as 3 integers, and stores them into V(1), V(2), and V(3).
%The ENCODE statement writes the values V(3), V(2), and V(1) into T as characters; T then contains '547698'.
